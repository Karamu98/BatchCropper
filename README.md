# BatchCropper
Just a simple tool that I made to crop images in a folder to given parameters.


# How to build
Call premake5 with desired target platform. Windows users can just run "GenerateProjects.bat" and this will generate vs2019 platform project/solution.

This has not been tested on any other platforms.
